# Welcome to my profile!

My name is Ricardo Hernandez, and I am a 2021 graduate of Gettysburg College with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, along with minors in Mathematics and Spanish. I have experience in various areas of software development, from back-end to front-end, and hold an AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate certification (2023-2026) from my time at Publicis Sapient. I am a quick learner who thrives in challenging environments, as I believe growth happens outside of our comfort zones.

My Catholic faith is integral to who I am, as it led me to take a year away from the workforce to enter Saint Charles Borromeo Seminary to discern the priesthood and explore how I can use my gifts and talents to serve others. During that year of prayer and discernment, I formed deep bonds with amazing friends—whom I prefer to call brothers—but ultimately felt a stronger calling to contribute to the world through my professional work. My heart’s desire is to combine my love for God and neighbor with my passion for software development.

I am passionate about making a positive impact on the world and improving the lives of others. While financial gain is not my primary motivation in this field, I am driven by the opportunity to serve others, whether in the workplace or through the products and services I help develop.

Outside of expanding my knowledge of software development, I enjoy spending time with God, my family, and friends, as well as working out, running, gardening, and playing guitar. Although I have loved computer science and technology since I was a child, I make a conscious effort to unplug from the screen to be present to those around me. While I believe work is sanctifying and good, I also recognize the importance of giving attention to those who need and want it.

- **Fun fact:** I love boxing and MMA, and I also enjoy watching both! During quarantine, my brothers and I created a small home gym to stay active and pass the time. We set up a boxing bag, a speed bag, and even did drills with mitts at one point. It was a lot of fun.
