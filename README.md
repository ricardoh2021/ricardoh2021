# Hi there! 👋 I'm Ricardo Hernandez

- 👀 I’m interested in full stack development, cloud technologies, and embedded systems. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and upskilling in full stack development through the 100 Days of Code challenge. I am also learning how to work with an Arduino on the side.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to web development, cloud computing, and IoT.
- 📫 How to reach me: [ricahernandez0001@gmail.com](mailto:ricahernandez0001@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardoh2021).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I took a year off to discern a vocation to the priesthood at Saint Charles Borromeo Seminary in Philadelphia, PA and served a 30-day poverty immersion mission trip to Port Chester, NY where I served the poor.
